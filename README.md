# 🧠 C++ Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of **C++ projects** developed as part of my learning journey through the **[Programming Advices](https://www.programmingadvices.com/)** roadmap.  
Each project is designed to strengthen my programming logic, apply problem-solving techniques, and practice custom implementations using my own functions — without relying on built-in functions or STL.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Apply core programming concepts through practical projects.
- Strengthen logic and flow control in real scenarios.
- Practice working with structs, enums, file handling, and user input/output.
- Avoid using built-in library functions to deepen algorithmic understanding.

## 📁 Projects Overview

- **🪨 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
  A console-based C++ game focused on:
  - Using `enum` types for player choices  
  - Organizing code with `struct`s and functions  
  - Practicing decision structures and game loops  
  - Logic-only (no design or graphics)

- **🏦 Bank1 Project**  
  A basic file-based banking system:
  - View all clients from a file  
  - Add new clients  
  - Update existing client data  
  - Delete clients  

- **💳 Bank2 Project (Extended)**  
  Builds on Bank1 with transaction features:
  - Deposit and withdraw operations  
  - Balance checking  
  - Enhanced logic and structured file management

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** C++  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Community  
- **Editor:** VS Code (for organization and edits)  
- **Approach:** Custom function-based logic, no STL or built-in helpers

## 💡 Why Use Custom Functions?

Writing my own functions helps me fully understand the logic behind common operations, build confidence in problem solving, and gain a deeper understanding of how things work under the hood.
